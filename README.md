### Cauê Mendes

Designing dynamic user interfaces with scrum mastery and an artistic eye.

I'm a front-end developer with a designer flair and scrum management expertise. After 4 years in the area, I continue to learn and improve myself because I like to study and my story went something like this.

        <td style="width: 14.28%; vertical-align: top;">I was born a chubby baby.</td>
        <td style="width: 14.28%; vertical-align: top;">I learned that computers were cool and I fussed with mine so much that I broke it.</td>
        <td style="width: 14.28%; vertical-align: top;">I created my clothing brand and had to perform multiple functions. 
            I had to close the doors a while later but I don't regret it.</td>
        <td style="width: 14.28%; vertical-align: top;">I graduated in business administration and found out I didn't fit in the area. This I regret.</td>
        <td style="width: 14.28%; vertical-align: top;">I joined an IT company called Draft It and worked as a designer and front-end developer.</td>
        <td style="width: 14.28%; vertical-align: top;">I started my solo career in the area as a freelancer managing projects and programming websites.</td>
        <td style="width: 14.28%; vertical-align: top;">I switched areas to Cybersecurity in parallel with my projects to seek new challenges.
            To me this area feels like a game where you need to be faster than your opponents.</td>
